Dataset Description
- travelClass:

Description: Indicates the class of travel, such as "3A" (Three-tier AC class). Different travel classes may have different probabilities of ticket confirmation.
Example: "3A", "2A", "SL".

- bookingStatus:

Description: Represents the booking status of the ticket. This may be a numerical value reflecting the booking status at the time of inquiry.
Example: 21, 14, 39.

- status1Day:

Description: Shows the status of the ticket 1 day before the train's departure. This could be a numerical value indicating the likelihood of confirmation.
Example: 28, 63, -1 (where -1 might indicate missing or not applicable).

- status1Month:

Description: Shows the status of the ticket 1 month before the train's departure. Similar to status1Day, this value helps assess the trend over a longer period.
Example: 12, -1.

- status1Week:

Description: Represents the ticket status 1 week before departure. This feature provides an intermediate status check.
Example: 14, -1.

- status2Days:

Description: Reflects the ticket status 2 days before the trainâ€™s departure. This is crucial for assessing the last-minute changes in ticket status.
Example: 15, 18, -1.

- Feature Encoding and Use

travelClass: This feature is encoded using mean encoding, where each unique class is replaced by the average target value (e.g., the average probability of ticket confirmation) for that class. This helps in capturing the categorical impact of travel class on the target variable.

bookingStatus, status1Day, status1Month, status1Week, status2Days: These features are numerical and represent various points in time or status indicators. They are directly used in the model to predict ticket confirmation, after handling missing values appropriately.

Example Feature Values

For an example row:

```
travelClass: "3A"
bookingStatus: 25
status1Day: 30
status1Month: 10
status1Week: 15
status2Days: 20
```

- travelClass: The ticket belongs to the "3A" class.
- status1Day: The status of the ticket 1 day before departure was 30.
- bookingStatus: The status of the booking is 25.
- status1Month: The status of the ticket 1 month before departure was 10.
- status1Week: The status of the ticket 1 week before departure was 15.
- status2Days: The status of the ticket 2 days before departure was 20.

This feature set helps the model understand various aspects of ticket booking and status changes, aiding in predicting whether a ticket will be confirmed or not.
